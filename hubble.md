# Hubble

Hubble is a simple Wordle-like game that finds five-letter words from your repo (e.g., issue comments) and chooses one each day for users to guess. 
While not specifically a dev tool, it does demonstrate the power and potential of ExtendoHub to monitor GitHub activity, store and aggregate relevant information, 
run business logic over the data both on-demand (via a UI or a command line) and in the background, and present the information to users in a variety of ways 
(e.g., JSON blobs from an API, GitHub-integrated UI, and standalone web sites). Besides, it's fun.

Here's a Hubble game for you to try:
